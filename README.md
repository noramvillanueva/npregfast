# npregfast: Nonparametric Estimation of Regression Models with Factor-by-Curve Interactions

```npregfast``` is an R package for obtain nonparametric estimates of regression models 
with or without factor-by-curve interactions using local polynomial kernel smoothers. 
Additionally, a parametric model (allometric model) can be estimated.

You can view a live interactive demo to see part of its capabilities at http://sestelo.shinyapps.io/npregfast.

## Installation
```npregfast``` is available through both CRAN and GitHub.

Get the released version from CRAN:
```
install.packages("npregfast")
```

Or the development version from GitHub:
```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sestelo/npregfast")
```
